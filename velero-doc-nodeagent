Velero without NodeAgent:
Backup and Restoration:
Velero can perform backup and restoration of Azure Blob and Azure File Share without PV data.
Unable to backup and restore managed-csi without NodeAgent.
Incapable of taking any data backup and performing restoration without NodeAgent.
Enabling NodeAgent:
Capabilities:

Enables Velero to backup and restore managed-csi.
Supports cluster version upgrades, increasing/decreasing node count, and PV data backup.
Allows backup and restoration of Azure Blob and Azure File Share without PV data for specific storage classes (e.g., Azureblob-nfs, Azurefile-csi-nfs).
Deployment:

NodeAgent is deployed as a DaemonSet.
Backup Commands:

For backup: velero backup create.
To exclude PV during backup: velero create backup --exclude pv --include-cluster-resources=true.
Restic/Kopia for specific storage classes (Managed-csi, Azureblob-nfs, Azurefile-csi-nfs):
Capabilities:

Supports cluster version upgrades, increasing/decreasing node count, and PV data backup.
Backup Commands:

During backup, use the command: velero create backup --default-volumes-to-fs-backup.
This command is applicable for all mentioned storage classes (Managed-csi, Azureblob-nfs, Azurefile-csi-nfs).
These points provide an overview of Velero's capabilities with and without NodeAgent, as well as the usage of Restic/Kopia for specific storage classes. The commands provided are examples of how to perform backups with certain configurations.
