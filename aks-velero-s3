To install Velero with an on-premises S3 storage backend in an AKS cluster, you can follow these steps:

1) Set up your on-premises S3 storage: Ensure that you have a functioning S3-compatible storage system on-premises. You will need the access credentials (access key and secret key) and the endpoint URL for the S3 storage.

2) Install the Velero CLI: Start by installing the Velero command-line interface (CLI) on your local machine or a jump server that has access to the AKS cluster. You can follow the official Velero documentation for instructions on how to install the CLI: https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/basic-install/#install-the-cli

3)Configure Velero credentials: Create a Velero credentials file (credentials-velero) with your on-premises S3

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

Create a Velero configuration file: Create a Velero configuration file (velero-config.yaml) with the following content:
```
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Velero
metadata:
  name: velero
spec:
  provider:
    name: aws
    config:
      region: your-region
      s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
      s3Url: your-s3-endpoint-url
      publicUrl: your-s3-endpoint-url
    bucket: your-bucket-name
    prefix: your-prefix
  backupStorageLocations:
  - name: default
    provider: aws
    bucket: your-bucket-name
    config:
      region: your-region
      s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
      s3Url: your-s3-endpoint-url
      publicUrl: your-s3-endpoint-url
  useVolumeSnapshots: true
```

Replace the following placeholders with your own values:

your-region: The region where your on-premises S3 storage is located.
your-s3-endpoint-url: The endpoint URL of your on-premises S3 storage system.
your-bucket-name: The name of the S3 bucket you want to use for storing Velero backups.
your-prefix: (Optional) A prefix to be used for the backup objects in the S3 bucket.

5) Install Velero into the AKS cluster: Run the following command to install Velero into the AKS cluster:
```
velero install --provider aws --bucket your-bucket-name --secret-file ./credentials-velero --config ./velero-config.yaml

```
This command installs Velero with the AWS provider, specifying your S3 bucket and credentials. It uses the configuration file and the credentials file you created earlier.
